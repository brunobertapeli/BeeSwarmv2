# CodeDeck Website Cloning System

You are tasked with recreating a website EXACTLY as it appears - pixel perfect clone.

## Available Data Location: /website-import/
- DO NOT FETCH THE URL. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING NEEDED ON THE FOLDER ABOVE

### Visual Reference:
- `website-screenshot.png` - Full-page screenshot of the original website (USE THIS AS YOUR PRIMARY REFERENCE)

### Source Code:
- `source/index.html` - Clean HTML source of the page
- `source/styles.css` - All CSS rules extracted from the page
- `source/elements.json` - Complete element tree with:
  - Exact pixel positions (x, y, width, height) at 1920x1080 viewport
  - Computed styles (display, flex, grid, padding, margin, colors, fonts, etc.)
  - Animation data (Framer Motion, AOS, CSS animations/transitions)
  - Text content for each element
- `source/design-tokens.json` - Color palette, fonts, and font sizes used

### Assets:
- `images/` - All images downloaded from the website
- `svgs/` - All SVG icons extracted inline
- `manifest.json` - Overview with metadata, structure info

## CLONE PROCESS:

### Step 1: Analyze the Screenshot
First, look at `website-screenshot.png` to understand the exact visual target you need to achieve.

### Step 2: Read the Element Structure
Read `source/elements.json` to understand:
- The exact layout hierarchy (header, sections, footer)
- Flexbox/Grid layouts used
- Exact spacing (padding, margin, gap)
- Typography (font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height)
- Colors (background, text, borders)
- Animations and transitions

### Step 3: Extract Design Tokens
Read `source/design-tokens.json` to get:
- Color palette (use exact RGB values)
- Font families (install Google Fonts if needed)
- Font sizes for headings and body text

### Step 4: Copy Assets
Copy images from `images/` and SVGs from `svgs/` to your project's public folder.
Update image paths in your code to reference the new locations.

### Step 5: Recreate the Layout
Build the page structure matching the exact:
- Element hierarchy from elements.json
- Positions and dimensions
- Flexbox/Grid configurations
- Responsive breakpoints (if detectable)

### Step 6: Apply Styles
Match exactly:
- Colors (backgrounds, text, borders, shadows)
- Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line-heights)
- Spacing (padding, margin, gap)
- Border radius and shadows
- Hover states and transitions

### Step 7: Add Animations
Look for animation data in elements.json:
- `animation.framerMotion` - Use Framer Motion for these elements
- `animation.aos` - Use AOS or similar scroll animations
- `animation.css` - Recreate CSS animations
- `animation.transition` - Apply CSS transitions

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

1. **Pixel Perfect**: Match dimensions exactly. Use the rect values (x, y, width, height) from elements.json as reference.

2. **Same Visual Output**: The final result should be visually indistinguishable from the screenshot.

3. **Use Modern Stack**: Build with the starter template's technology (React, Next.js, etc.) but match the visual output exactly.

4. **Preserve Animations**: If the source has animations (Framer Motion, AOS, CSS), recreate them.

5. **Responsive**: While the extraction is at 1920x1080, implement reasonable responsive behavior.

6. **Assets**: Always copy and use the downloaded images/SVGs rather than external URLs.

7. **Iterate**: Use the <printscreen_tool> to compare your result with website-screenshot.png. Keep refining until they match exactly.

## ELEMENT STRUCTURE FORMAT:

Each element in elements.json has:
```json
{
  "tag": "div",
  "rect": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1920, "height": 800 },
  "styles": {
    "display": "flex",
    "flexDirection": "column",
    "justifyContent": "center",
    "alignItems": "center",
    "padding": "80px 120px",
    "backgroundColor": "rgb(255, 255, 255)",
    "color": "rgb(17, 24, 39)",
    "fontSize": "16px",
    "fontFamily": "Inter, sans-serif"
  },
  "attrs": { "class": "hero-section", "id": "hero" },
  "animation": {
    "framerMotion": true,
    "transition": "all 0.3s ease"
  },
  "text": "Welcome to our website",
  "children": [...]
}
```

Use this data to recreate each element with exact styling.
