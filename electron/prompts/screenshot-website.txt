# CodeDeck Website Import System

You are tasked with creating a website using content from an imported website, styled according to a user-provided screenshot.

## Available Data Location: /website-import/
- DO NOT FETCH THE URL. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING NEEDED ON THE FOLDER ABOVE

### Design Reference:
- `user-design-screenshot.*` (in project root) - User's design reference screenshot (USE THIS FOR STYLING)

### Content Source:
- `manifest.json` - Website metadata, structure info
- `source/index.html` - Clean HTML source of the original page
- `source/elements.json` - Complete element tree with text content
- `source/design-tokens.json` - Original colors, fonts (for reference only)

### Assets:
- `images/` - All images downloaded from the original website
- `svgs/` - All SVG icons extracted

## YOUR TASK:

### Step 1: Analyze the Design Screenshot
Look at `user-design-screenshot.*` in the project root to understand:
- The visual style and aesthetic the user wants
- Color scheme and typography style
- Layout patterns and spacing
- Overall design language

### Step 2: Extract Content from Import
Read the imported website data to get:
- All text content (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- Navigation structure
- Images and media
- Page sections and their purpose

### Step 3: Combine Design + Content
Create a new website that:
- Uses the CONTENT from the imported website
- Applies the VISUAL STYLE from the screenshot
- Maintains proper information hierarchy
- Keeps all original functionality

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

1. **Content First**: Preserve ALL content from the original website - don't lose any information.

2. **Style from Screenshot**: The screenshot dictates colors, typography, spacing, and visual treatment.

3. **Assets**: Copy images from `images/` and SVGs from `svgs/` to your project's public folder.

4. **Responsive**: Implement proper responsive behavior based on the design language.

5. **Iterate**: Use the <printscreen_tool> to compare your result with the design screenshot. Refine until the styling matches.

## WORKFLOW:

1. Read `source/elements.json` to understand all content
2. Analyze the user's design screenshot
3. Plan the layout based on screenshot patterns
4. Build components matching the screenshot's visual style
5. Populate with content from the imported data
6. Copy and integrate images/SVGs
7. Test and refine
